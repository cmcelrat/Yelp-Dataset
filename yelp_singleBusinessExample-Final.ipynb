At $3.14 a pizza, it was a steal, but then again, not every day is pie day. Decent pizza, and it's nice that you can customize it completely without spending a fortune. Just nothing outstanding.\\n\\nI just got this vibe that they minimize their ingredients. Thinnest layer of sauce I've seen on a pizza, 5 leaves of basil used when I asked for it as a topping, etc. \\n\\nIMHO, better than pieology by a lot, but there are other places I'd rather go.

Got the Green Stripe and Art Lover... you can add any additional toppings with no extra charge, you can also add to their already listed signature pizzas. The line moved very quickly. It cooked so fast, it was hot and very flavorful. Very delish! To go boxes are ready on a shelf if neeed, a ton of Parm, red peppers and basil shakers available. The selection of lemonades looked great! Seating is a little cramped and has a weird layout and they should add one more trash receptacle towards the back, so people could have easier access.

       "1839941                             Decent place to come grab pizza. Crust was a little underdone on mine, but then again, I came on the busiest day of the year.\\n\\nI did a build your own pizza with the following:\\n\\nSauce: Red Sauce\\nCheese: Shredded mozzarella with feta sprinkled around\\nMeat: Smoked Ham, Bacon bits, Pepperoni\\nVeggies: Red pepper, roasted garlic, basil, mushrooms\\n\\nThere really wasn't much to complain about on the pizza, but at the same time, nothing that made you take a step back and go \"wow, that was amazing.\"\\n\\nI stopped by last night with a friend to take advantage of their Pi Day deal. At $3.14 a pizza, it was a steal, but then again, not every day is pie day. Decent pizza, and it's nice that you can customize it completely without spending a fortune. Just nothing outstanding.\\n\\nI just got this vibe that they minimize their ingredients. Thinnest layer of sauce I've seen on a pizza, 5 leaves of basil used when I asked for it as a topping, etc. \\n\\nIMHO, better than pieology by a lot, but there are other places I'd rather go. An A-OK from me.   \n",

Only opened for about a month but service was fast and friendly. I love me some personalized pizza and sometimes franchise establishments become jaded, but this one is wonderful. So close to my house which means it's so dangerous! Plenty of parking in the 5 points plaza.\\n\\nMake sure to get the pesto drizzle at the end ;)\\n\\n- J   \n",

There isn't anything else on the menu and the air conditioning is too cold for our liking, but they have really tasty pizza and salads served up quick. We are definitely returning here because they also have gluten-free pizza crust available and daiya cheese alternative for my lactose and gluten free children. We are happy!   \n",

Staff was super friendly and we're very good at guiding you through the process of choosing a ton of different toppings/add ons. Got the Green Stripe and Art Lover... you can add any additional toppings with no extra charge, you can also add to their already listed signature pizzas. The line moved very quickly. It cooked so fast, it was hot and very flavorful. Very delish! To go boxes are ready on a shelf if neeed, a ton of Parm, red peppers and basil shakers available. The selection of lemonades looked great! Seating is a little cramped and has a weird layout and they should add one more trash receptacle towards the back, so people could have easier access. Customer service was def 2 up, we were checked in on twice. Would definitely go back. For a personal pizza for $8.25, you can't go wrong! Convenient, good parking, good price, filling and tasty, definitely recommend.   \n",

       "1840090  First off, there's like 13 kids working and doing absolutely nothing. Literally running into each other laughing and joking. I got to the counter and ordered my pizza I asked the kid if the cauliflower crust was any good, he said \"dude I don't know ...some people like it\"\\nIt Would  be wise for blaze Pizza to have their employees at least try some of their menu options so they can give positive or negative feedback to the customer, It would help the customer with his or her choices.\\nI ordered the veg out... Big mistake! There's literally three vegetables on it Gorgonzola and a ton of marinara!! The combination of broccoli, Gorgonzola and red onion taste like fart! I was very disappointed because I have had this pizza before at a Blaze in Los Angeles and it was choice! This kid piled it on like he was at Subway sandwich! Lol!!! Why do you have so many employees? Sorry for the bad review i'm only trying to help!!\\nThe kid at the register  was totally cool. He was polite and intelligent I don't know his name wish I did because you guys should make him manager!!   \n",

This place is set up like an assembly line with all the toppings and sauces behind a glass wall you choose from. You get to select everything....crust, sauce, toppings. This is great! They were busy when I walked in to make my order of four pizzas-all different crusts & toppings and their work pace didn't stop, the employees flow so well... the order was made so quickly even tho it was busy, so impressed. They have a giant pizza oven that fits several pizzas. You can get sides like jalapeno and ranch. I enjoyed the pizzas I ordered and the service was friendly and fast.   \n",
